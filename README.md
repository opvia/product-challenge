## Seal product problem

Scientists are automatically uploading their data from bioreactors into Seal. To help you, some example data is already loaded into a table.

In the example data, each row shows the density of the cells and the total volume in the bioreactor at a given point in time.

The scientists want to calculate the cell count at any point in time, as well as being able to see the maximum cell count.

Instead of building in these features, we have identified two higher level features to build which would solve their problem, and would be useful to all of our customers:

1. `Calculation columns`, these are columns in the table that are populated based on a user defined formula e.g. A cell count column that is created by the formula: `Cell Density * Volume` 
2.  A `Column Aggregations` feature which allows a user to perform operations on a selected data column, such as showing the `Maximum Density`, `Minimum Cell Count`, etc...

You have a meeting scheduled with the scientist who is a customer. Build something they will be use on your laptop to give you feedback. Please use <a href="https://blueprintjs.com/">Blueprintjs</a>.

Put any notes and your instructions in the README as well as what you would do next to improve this. Please also answer how you would make it possible to do `Rate of change calculations` e.g. `Rate of Cell Count Growth`
